Hummingbird is a front-end framework that aims to give clear separation of code. CSS and Javascript should not be located in the HTML. The goal of the framework is to have as much ready made code as possible. For instance the user needs only to modify skin.css to apply a style to a website. Also, interface.js is the only javascript that a developer needs to modify.
To install simply download the package to reveal the following folder structure:
/css (contains the Cascading Style Sheet files)
/js (contains the JavaScript files)
/img (contains images refrenced in the HTML)
/samples (contains a range of example templates and jQuery plugins)

And the following files:
index.html
template.html
