Pollenizer Hummingbird
Hummingbird contains three component types. First the HTML, second the CSS and finally the Javascript.
This framework aims to give clear separation of code. CSS and Javascript should not be located in the HTML. The goal of the framework is to have as much ready made code as possible. For instance the user needs only to modify skin.css to apply a style to a website. also, interface.js is the only javascript that a developer needs to modify.
